                    The Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty is tied to the monthly premium. If you delay signing up for Part B, you will be charged an additional 10% for each 12-month period you went without coverage once you became eligible. This penalty will be added to your standard monthly premium and will last for as long as you have Part B.
